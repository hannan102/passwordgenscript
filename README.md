# passwordgenscript
This script uses the head and tr commands to generate a random password consisting of alphanumeric characters. If you prefer a passphrase that includes spaces and punctuation, you can use the pwgen command instead. The password or passphrase is then written to a file, and the file permissions are set to 600 (read and write access for owner only).

The file will have read and write access for the owner only. You can open the file to view the password or passphrase by running the following command in the terminal:
